# Aim
I do not think we need a whole UI, what we need is a good way to resolve the problem. 
At the begining, I gave this solution to give a eye-lightening solution to Front End.
I do not think React, Vuejs, Angularjs can solve every problem for Front End.

# use it
1. npm i;
2. npm run build
3. open the page you want to see in the browser.
